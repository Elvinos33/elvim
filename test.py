# Harmonic Series Introduction

# Harmonic Series Introduction
# The harmonic series is the sum of reciprocals of all positive integers up to a given number n.
# Mathematically, it is expressed as H(n) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n.
# The series is known for its slow convergence; even for large n, it grows slowly.


def harmonic_series(n):
    """
    Calculate the n-th harmonic number.

    The harmonic number H(n) is defined as the sum of the reciprocals of the first n natural numbers.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of terms in the harmonic series.

    Returns:
    float: The n-th harmonic number.

    Calculate the difference between the n-th harmonic number and the logarithm of n with a given base.

    This function computes the harmonic number H(n) and the logarithm of n with the specified base,
    then returns the difference between these two values.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of terms in the harmonic series.
    base (float): The base of the logarithm.
